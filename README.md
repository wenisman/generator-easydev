# Easy Generator
> The generator for all your projects

[NPM site][npm-url]

The generators will help you get your projects up and running... FAST!

The idea behon the generators is that there is a lot of boiler plate code that goes into making your application run for the first time. So lets have a tool that can get your guys working faster, lets have the ideas and make them with minimal time on the boring stuff and more time on the making of stuff.


If you think the generators need to be altered then feel free to make the PR, lets make this a tool for everyone.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-smfed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm i -g yo easy-generator
```

Then generate your new project in the system components folder:

```bash
yo easy-generator [ express ]
```

Then you just need to follow the prompts and you will have a working application once the generator finishes.
